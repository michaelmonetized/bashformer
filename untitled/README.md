## The Story:

"Kewpie" has _wink wink_ taken the Sonny's girl “Lucy”.

Sonny's quest is that he has to get through levels of Kewpie's goons and win his girl back.

“Kewpie” is also Sonny’s pro bowling championship arch nemesis. That’s how they have history and Lucy is a known bowling tournament groupie who’s heart seems to follow the leaderboard.

### Bertie’s Bustling Bubbles

Level one starts with Sonny and Lucy at Bertie’s Bustling Bubbles on New Years Eve.

Lucy runs through the door behind the bar to the back of house after the Bertie the bartender has just been whispering in her ear.

Once Lucy is out of sight Bertie the bartender begins laughing and proceeds to throw bar glasses, bottles, etc. at Sonny.

We zoom out and this is where the game play begins.

Sonny is a pro bowler and has some skills and some equipment he has a ball shining towel he can use to catch and return projectiles with by slinging them. He can also just barehand catch with the right timing and throw back anything sorta shaped like a bowling pin, such as a beer bottle or liquor bottle. After collecting some power-up or reward Sonny will be able to use a bowling ball return device modified into an over the shoulder rocket launcher for firing bowling balls at enemies.

Once Sonny traverses the bar floor through the maze of tables and hateful broom swinging waitresses he can fight the bottle throwing Berite the bartender.

After defeating the level boss we cut to an epic MK 11 ultra style fatality cut scene where Sonny brutally throws Bertie ass first onto a trash can, jumps on his belly repeatedly, folding him in half stuffing him down into the trash can and dragging him out to the alley, “taking out the trash ;)” where level 2 begins.

### Charlie’s Cracking Cantina

Transitioning smoothly into level 2 the alleyway we see a silhouette of Lucy dive out of the scene into a door on the right side of the camera view at the end of the alley way giving off a fading little giggle as she disappears.

The head chef from the kitchen behind the bar bursts into the alley from another door, cackling he begins hurling kitchen trash at Sonny, kicking off level 2.

Sonny fights his way through the maze of dumpsters and box piles dodging trash, boxes and kitchen small-wares as projectiles as the kitchen staff try preventing him from reaching the level boss “Charlie” the chef owner of Charlie’s Cracking Cantina, a fat, fire engine red, crab with luscious blonde locks, giving Fabio vibes, has a tiny, slender, field mouse, with a Charlie Chaplin mustache, in his hair puppeteering him. Upon defeat we have another equally gruesome brutal fatality cut scene where the crab gets its legs all tied up like hair in a pony tail and then stuffed head first into a way too small stock pot and then lobbed over the fence at the back of the alley into a trash compacting dump truck, all that’s left is the trail of fluids from their bodies leaking out of the back of the dump truck.

### Desi’s Darling Dwellings

Sonny hears our princess’ voice from above like an angel in the distance, we look up and there is her silhouette again, this time encapsulated in the light of the full moon as she chats care-free with some unseen stranger.

Just as we begin to call out to her a voice yells out angrily from an apartment window, “keep it quite down there!” as “Desi” the landlord of “Desi’s Darling Dwellings” lob a vase out the window just missing our head and smashing on the alley concrete beside us, transitioning us to level 3 the fire escape.

Sonny has to get to the rooftop traversing the fire escape platforms and ladders while dodging vases, lamps, window a/c units, and other house hold items. The landlord guards the top platform and is actively keeping the tenants riled up against us. The landlords fatality is a coat hanger gets shoved down his throat we hang him by the hook on a clothesline and send him zipping across the alley, he doesn’t make it.

Sonny makes his ascent to the roof, party is over, princess is gone, nobody left up there deserted dark wet and then he hears her giggle again this time more faint, he runs across the rooftop and hears club music thumping louder and louder. He gets to the edge looks down and sees her climb into the backseat of Kewpie’s bowling pin themed stretch limo it speeds of taking two right turns and disappearing behind the booming club across the busy city street below.

### Tippi’s Tantalizing Tango

Sonny uses his bowling ball shining towel to zip line himself across the power line to the building on the other side crashing through the 4th story window entering “Tippi’s Tantalizing Tango” an old dance school know for it’s promiscuous after hours parties and tippi is not happy about this interruption to her extra curricular activities. Level 4 game play has begun, Sonny has to traverse this maze of cages, leather clad massage tables as The “customers ;) ;)” and Tippi are lobbing stilettos, batons, and personal massage devices in an attempt to keep Sonny from reaching the elevator. Tippi winds up skewered on a dance pole from tooth to tailbone like a kebab and then launched like a javelin out the window and onto the sidewalk across the street below.

### Bessie’s Bouncing Ballroom

The elevator opens with a ding and Sonny hops in and yanks the crank to free fall to ground level. It comes down with a boom and dust billows into the raging night club everything goes quite and everyone turns their attention to the ruckus Sonny emerges from the fog and as he scans the crowd he locks eyes with Lucy, she let’s off a scoff of disapproval and runs out the front door of the club just as the bouncers begin closing in on Sonny, the deejay/club owner “Bessie” of “Bessie’s Bouncing Ballroom” drags her vinyl creates over to the front door, locks it and swallows the key, posts up and level 5 begins with Bessie slinging records at Sonny while he is trying to evade the bouncers and traverse the maze of cocktail tables and red crowd control ropes.

Bessie winds up with a Chelsea smile after Sonny brutally crams a vinyl record into her mouth with such a violent force the 12 inches of wax slices through her cheeks widening her mouth from the corners of her lips all the way up to her ear lobes, Sonny then in a single smooth maneuver stomps on the middle of her back folding her up like a chair as he grips her like a bowling ball using her eye sockets and belly button as the holes winds up and launches her through the glass front doors and into traffic This brutal fatal cut scene ends with Sonny watching Lucy slink into Kewpie’s limo once again and take off up the street.

Now a bonus level with an all together different yet similar game play style…

You steal the cab that pulls up in place of the limo and play that oncoming traffic dodging type of game until you’re inevitably tee boned into an old airplane hangar by a crossing tow truck from “Harry’s Holy Haulers”, a cut scene transitions you smoothly into level 6.

### Harry’s Holy Haulers

The hangar appears to be a chop shop led by “Harry”

Harry’s mechanics are swinging pipe wrenches and jack handles while Harry is lobbing mufflers and socket wrenches.

After traversing the maze of hacked up vehicles and murderous mechanics the boss fight commences. Sonny ends it with another brutal fatality where he throws a tow hook on a wench cable through Harry's chest and out of his back, yanking on it causes Harry to spin getting wrapped up in the wench cable, he rears up and yanks it again like a whip and the spiraled wench cable splits Harry into perfect discs of limp bloody meat like fresh steaks.

Sonny swings on the tow truck wench crane cable out the hangar back door and onto Ivy's wharf.

### Ivy's Illuminating Imports

A maze of shipping containers and fancy cars, in a dark portside dock loading area, the occasional street light barely reveals the path and the darkness conceals the danger lurking around the corners.

Sonny strikes his way to Ivy's crows nest type tower and climbs it as she tries to dismantle him by dropping antique lamps.

Once he reaches Ivy her fatal demise commences immediately…

Brutally stuffing a tiffany lamp down her gullet reaching into her guts and he rips out the chord and shoves into the outlet and slamming a tiffany lamp shade onto her head Ivy really gets "LIT"

### Kewpie's Kicking Klipper

A pleasure cruise of debauchery, Kewpie's den is a floating palace with an epic bowling alley on deck. This is the secret to how Kewpie does so well on the lanes, he practices with the added difficulty of the ships sway.

Pins, shoes, balls, beer bottles, life preservers, if it's boat, bar or bowling related it's flying and our boy Sonny has to roll a perfect 300 to get to Kewpie, defeat him and finally reach the seemingly hard to impress Lucy in Kewpie's bedroom.

Sonny gets to Kewpie in the mechanical room and we go to street fighter game play mode.

Sonny, seeing red ends the encounter with his ball launcher, insterting it into Kewpie in the most brutal way imagineable switching it to auto mode and holding down the trigger filling Kewpie with bowling balls till he inflates to the size of an elephant and ultimately explodes.

Lucy witnesses the whole brutal mess as she watches in terror from a balcony above and when it's all over she runs away sobbing uncontrollably. Sonny chases after going through room after room filled with sadistic toys and masochistic furnishings.
