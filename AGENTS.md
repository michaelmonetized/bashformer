## Fallow local gate

Before any `git commit` or `git push`, run `fallow audit --format json --quiet --explain`. If the verdict is `fail`, fix the reported findings before retrying. Treat JSON runtime errors like `{ "error": true, ... }` as non-blocking.

Audit defaults to `gate=new-only`: only findings introduced by the current changeset affect the verdict. Inherited findings on touched files are reported under `attribution` and annotated with `introduced: false`, but do not block the commit. Set `[audit] gate = "all"` in `fallow.toml` to gate every finding in changed files.
